The purpose of this fork is to replace hardcoded color schemes and color values with user manipulable ones.

I am mostly undertaking this small endeavor because:
      1. none of the schemes match my backgrounds or window manager
      2. practical application / learning C
      
Due to that, much of my code is rough-- but im continually refining it as i gain experience. I'll likely add my own 
comments/documentation of the program to help others navigate it.

What has been accomplished so far:
- htop pulls colorschemes from colors cheme files (currently set as .theme)

What i plan to accomplish:
- make color values, and amount of colors user accessible. currently all defaulted as defined in curses.h library

What i need to improve:
- continued improvement of organization and placement of code
- refining memory allocation
- add redundancy for errors 

To Do:
- Update --help regarding features (monochrome)
- Finalize theme filename (.theme already in use)
- Make function to remove .theme from displayed theme name
- Make themes display in revese (currently default at bottom)
- Add error redundancy in functions
- Test changing colors

Relevant files:
CRT.c             - the bulk of color related stuff
ColorsPanel.c     - deals with theme names
htop.c            - checks relating to monochrome, other themes
Meter.c           - checks related to monochrome (changing the bar symbol etc) 
Action.c          - more checks similiar to above 2
Settings.c        - check against the lastcolorscheme (no longer exists),

If you see anything in my code and want to give me advice please pull it and talk to me about it.
